# Virtual Kitchen

Welcome to the Virtual ktchen repository!

This is a small app that I made to practice building with a react frontend (and also nextjs) in collaboration with ThreeJS (React-Three Fiber)
Virtual Kitchen is aimed at noobs around the kitchen.
Don't know what's in your fridge? Don't worry! Visit Virtual Kitchen and you'll know what there is and how much there is!
In Virtual Kitchen, you can add items, update items, and remove items to keep things simple.
